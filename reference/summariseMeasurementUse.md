# Diagnostics of a codelist of measurement codes in the database

Diagnostics of a codelist of measurement codes in the database

## Usage

``` r
summariseMeasurementUse(
  cdm,
  codes,
  byConcept = TRUE,
  byYear = FALSE,
  bySex = FALSE,
  ageGroup = NULL,
  dateRange = as.Date(c(NA, NA)),
  estimates = list(measurement_summary = c("min", "q25", "median", "q75", "max",
    "density"), measurement_value_as_numeric = c("min", "q01", "q05", "q25", "median",
    "q75", "q95", "q99", "max", "count_missing", "percentage_missing", "density"),
    measurement_value_as_concept = c("count", "percentage")),
  checks = c("measurement_summary", "measurement_value_as_numeric",
    "measurement_value_as_concept")
)
```

## Arguments

- cdm:

  A reference to the cdm object.

- codes:

  A codelist of measurement/observation codes for which to perform
  diagnostics.

- byConcept:

  TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by concept.

- byYear:

  TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by year.

- bySex:

  TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by sex.

- ageGroup:

  If not NULL, a list of ageGroup vectors of length two.

- dateRange:

  Two dates. The first indicating the earliest measurement date and the
  second indicating the latest possible measurement date.

- estimates:

  A named list indicating, for each measurement diagnostics check, which
  estimates to retrieve. The names of the list should correspond to the
  diagnostics checks, and each list element should be a character vector
  specifying the estimates to compute.

  Allowed estimates are those supported by the \`summariseResult()\`
  function in the \*\*PatientProfiles\*\* package. If omitted, all
  available estimates for each check will be returned.

- checks:

  Diagnostics to run. Options are: "measurement_summary",
  "measurement_value_as_numeric", and "measurement_value_as_concept".

## Value

A summarised result

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
library(MeasurementDiagnostics)

cdm <- mockMeasurementDiagnostics()

result <- summariseMeasurementUse(
  cdm = cdm, codes = list("test_codelist" = c(3001467L, 45875977L))
)
