# Plot summariseMeasurementTiming results.

Plot summariseMeasurementTiming results.

## Usage

``` r
plotMeasurementValueAsConcept(
  result,
  x = "count",
  y = "codelist_name",
  facet = c("cdm_name"),
  colour = c("concept_name", "variable_level", visOmopResults::strataColumns(result)),
  style = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- result:

  A summarised_result object.

- x:

  Columns to use as horizontal axes. See options with
  \`visOmopResults::plotColumns(result)\`.

- y:

  Columns to use as horizontal axes. See options with
  \`visOmopResults::plotColumns(result)\`.

- facet:

  Columns to facet by. See options with
  \`visOmopResults::plotColumns(result)\`. Formula input is also allowed
  to specify rows and columns.

- colour:

  Columns to color by. See options with
  \`visOmopResults::plotColumns(result)\`.

- style:

  Pre-defined style to apply: "default" or "darwin" - the latter just
  for gt and flextable. If NULL the "default" style is used.

## Value

A ggplot.

``` r
# \donttest{

cdm <- mockMeasurementDiagnostics()

result <- summariseMeasurementUse(
  cdm = cdm,
  bySex = TRUE,
  codes = list("test_codelist" = c(3001467L, 45875977L))
